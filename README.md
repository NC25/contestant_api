# contestant_api

The Iowa State Fair is looking to bring their registration and contest-management system to the web and is seeking to build a backend service with the following features:

Register a contestant/husband pair
Get a list of all contestants
Perform a "husband call" and score it
Get the highest-score shout across all contestants (INDUSTRY ONLY)
Buy a power-up item (INDUSTRY ONLY)
In particular, they want you to build an API capable of handling all of the functionality mentioned above.
